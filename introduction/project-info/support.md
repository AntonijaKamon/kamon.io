Support
=======

We know that succeeding with a tool is not just about reading docs and following steps, sometimes you need guidance that
is tailored to your needs and environment, so we are taking very seriously the need to provide solid support on all
Kamon features as well as enhancing Kamon according to the needs of our users.

Currently we offer support for Kamon through our [mailing list] and through the [gitter channel], please feel free to
send any question you might have regarding using Kamon in it's current state or how to extend it to be used in your
specific enviroment. We will do our best effort to respond timely and accurately to your questions.

Also, we are preparing ourselves to provide commercial support and services related to Kamon, stay tunned for more
information on that matter. If you can't wait until then, please contact either [Ivan] or [Diego] directly, they both
speak English and Spanish.
